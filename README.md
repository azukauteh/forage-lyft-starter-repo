# Lyft Fleet Management System

The Lyft Fleet Management System is a Python program for managing the service needs of Lyft's car fleet, including engine, battery, and tire servicing.

## Overview

This project was completed as part of Lft Back-End Engineering job simulation. The tasks involved taking over the development of an unfinished project, designing a new architecture, refactoring a messy codebase, and implementing new functionality using test-driven development.

### Project Highlights

- Job Simulation Completion : Successfully completed the Back-End Engineering job simulation for Lyft Rentals, gaining valuable insights into the development process within the team.

- UML Class Diagram : Drafted a UML class diagram that represents a new reorganized architecture for the Lyft Fleet Management System. This diagram serves as a visual guide to the project's structure .

- Code Refactoring : Took on the challenge of refactoring a messy codebase inherited from another team. The goal was to accurately reflect the new design outlined in the UML class diagram. This effort aimed to improve code maintainability and extensibility.

- Test-Driven Development : Implemented unit tests to ensure the reliability and correctness of the system. New functionality was added following the principles of test-driven development (TDD), contributing to a robust and stable codebase.
